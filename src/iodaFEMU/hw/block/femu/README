Before running a workload, if you want to...
To enable Synchronized GC, run flip 8 in the VM
To disable Synchronized GC, run flip 9 in the VM
To adjust how big this window is, run flip [12/13/14/15/16/17/18] in the VM
So far, 100MS window looks best, but 40MS, 200MS, 400MS look okay as well

Options for flip command are in nvme-core.c
```c
enum {
    FEMU_ENABLE_GC_DELAY = 1,
    FEMU_DISABLE_GC_DELAY = 2,

    FEMU_ENABLE_DELAY_EMU = 3,
    FEMU_DISABLE_DELAY_EMU = 4,

    FEMU_RESET_ACCT = 5,
    FEMU_ENABLE_LOG = 6,
    FEMU_DISABLE_LOG = 7,

    FEMU_SYNC_GC = 8,
    FEMU_UNSYNC_GC = 9,

    FEMU_ENABLE_LOG_FREE_BLOCKS = 10,
    FEMU_DISABLE_LOG_FREE_BLOCKS = 11,

    FEMU_WINDOW_1S = 12,
    FEMU_WINDOW_100MS = 13,
    FEMU_WINDOW_2S = 14,
    FEMU_WINDOW_10MS = 15,
    FEMU_WINDOW_40MS = 16,
    FEMU_WINDOW_200MS = 17,
    FEMU_WINDOW_400MS = 18,

};
```
